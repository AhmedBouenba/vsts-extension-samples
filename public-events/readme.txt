This sample is implemented with TypeScript (http://typescriptlang.org). For your convenience, the compiled JavaScript files are included in the ./out directory. 

If you would like to edit this sample, you can re-compile by running the following command from this directory (you will need the TypeScript compiler in your PATH):
tsc -p .
