# Fabrikam sample app

This is a clone of the "Build" sample app, written in TypeScript. App must be built prior to installation. To build, run `build.cmd` from a command prompt. You must have the TypeScript compiler installed at %APPDATA%\npm\tsc.cmd. If not, you can install it by running `npm install -g typescript`. If you don't have npm installed, it comes packaged with Node.js, which can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/).
